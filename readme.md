# Flask App.

The content of the application is yet to be chosen. Currently learning how to manipulate flask

## Files
If you are reading this, i assume you know how flask works (or somewhat know) all the required files in order to run flask were not uploaded for obvious reasons (Just download flask and you can run it, can't do it all for you)

The files that have been uploaded are purely to show the logic and path i took to learn flask.


## Usage
Yet to be defined. I am thinking of building a manager/supervisor management system to monitor staff task and progress in real time.
Providing information such as productivity ( for example, measured as per money transferred per hour for a stock broker or for customers served for a retail/hospitality chain).
